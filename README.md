just a fun project to visualise where a potentiol team would be weak to / if i have total coverage,
first time working with getters and setter in python | worked with last about 4 years ago (from start of project) in javascript....

todo:
- add strenghts to counteract weaknesses on dual types.
- add immunities
- upgrade the app to be compatable with more than 1 pokemon.
- make a window that visualises the types of the pokemon, their weaknesses, and overal team weaknesses.
- maybe add a window to visualise what pokemon resist what type for the team, taking into account weaknesses of other team members (example: a pure fire covering pure grass for a pure water type)
